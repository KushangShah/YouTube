# YouTube
I know that youtube module already exist but, that one stoped working! Well it's not like I made a new module i just found a way to use youtube module in different way. This ipynb (python notebook) save the video on your drive directly and you can download from there(drive). It feel stupid to wast so much internet but hey, it's working.
